                6 eggs
              </li>
          <li>
                A pinch of salt
              </li>
          <li>

        </ul>
    <h3>
          <i>Steps</i>
        </h3>
    <p>
         
        </p>
    <ol>
          <li>
                Cut the chocolate into pieces. Place chocolate chips in a large bowl.
              </li>
          <li>
                Heat the milk and cream in a saucepan just until boiling. Remove from heat and keep you.
              </li>
          <li>
                Cut the butter into small pieces.
              </li>
          <li>
                Separate the eggs. Beat the egg whites very stiff with salt and sugar. In the last seconds before turning off the mixer, add the egg yolks.
              </li>
          <li>
                Add the milk and cream mixture to chocolate. Mix well until the chocolate melts. I recommend using a fou√© to stir the mixture until the temperature about 40 degrees, slightly warmer than its lip. Add butter and continue mixing until melted.
              </li>
          <li>
                Add a little of the chocolate mixture to eggs. Mix gently with a spatula silicon. Then add the egg mixture once the chocolate mixture, incorporating everything with gentle movements that do not lose the clear air. Mix just until uniform with a mousse.
              </li>
          <li>
                Transfer mixture to bowl in which you want to serve. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
